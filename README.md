# Welcome to My Blog

This is the first blog I have ever built. With this blog I want to docment some stuff I am doing. Nothing special and even might not relavent to programming. But here are something in the specific field like accounting. I will try my best to explain these professional concept very clear and understandable because this is the way I tested if I understood the concept. So hope you will find what you need in my blog when you need specific knowledge and its in my area.
## Frequency
I am not a very good writer and my work is also not very good. So based on my estimation of my ability maybe 2 to 3 articles per week. To really practice my writing, I will try to explain some concept or idea really thorough and might be a little wordy. Of course, I will correct any kind of problems once I noticed. 
## Content
Right now my articles will foucs on a few things that are unrelavent. 
### 1. python programming
To be honest I am still out of the door. I have read some material about python, but I still cannot write a python program. This time I will start from the beginning, and update my learning and my practicing to this blog. It can be very embarrassing at first. But I hope I can write something help me processing my work someday in the furture.
### 2. Accounting
This is what I am going to learn from Spetember this year to June next year. So this is my professional. My goal is to get CPA and ACCA certificates. To urge me learning(acctually I cannot keep one thing up for one month), I will post my learning experience. It will include some basic accounting concepts and the idea behind them(of course what I understand).
### 3. CPA & ACCA program
As I have said I want to get these two certificates, I will put my perparing note for these exams in this blog.

This is what I planed to put at this moment. I may adjust that for circumstances and I will explain why I opened a new area in the first artile posted in that area.
